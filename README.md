# Gamehub

A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.
This site is a dummy online store for games.

Description
This site is made for the purpose of buying and selling games. On this site you can trade games with other gamers.
The purpose of this is that you can sell your used games to gamers that havent played your game or sell/trade 
with other gamers. You will also have the new releases available.
